# Project Title

De novo design of transmembrane beta-barrels

## Description

This folder contains all the inptuts necessary to generate new sequence-agnostic beta-barrel backbones using Rosetta fragment assembly protocol.
The files are further described in the Material and Methods section of the manuscript.

### Prerequisites

It is necessary to obtain a licence and install the Rosetta Molecular Modelling Suite. The latest version of Rosetta that was used to test this code is provided in the Material and Methods section of the manuscript. The results are analyzed in the provided Jupyter Notebook.

## Acknowledgments

This protocol was inspired and improved based on earlier work on beta-sheet design by Nobu Koga and Enrique Marcos. Hahnbeom Park contributed to the optimization of the centroid weights used for the minimization step.
