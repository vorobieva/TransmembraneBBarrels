This is the workflow to design transmembrane beta-barrels. 
For each round of designs, the exact command is in the batch_run.py file in the directory. The list of jobs is task.list. The jobs were submitted to slurm with the cmd.jobs script. 
The output of the design runs were analyzed with the associated jupyter notebook. 
The name of the pdb files are retained through the different rounds of designs, so that the final designs can be traced to parent backbones and all intermediates.

1. Assemble centroid backbones as previously described. 
XML file:
/home/av9/beta_barrel/bluePrintBuild/membrane_barrel/backbones_1/input.xml
The input files are located directly in the /home/av9/beta_barrel/bluePrintBuild/membrane_barrel/backbones_1/ directory. 

2. The best centroid backbones were selected (backbones_analysis.ipynb). A dummy sequence is designed to refine the backbones in full-atom mode (in best_200; xml file design.xml).
The lowest energy designs were selected in the jupyter notebook backbones_analysis.ipynb and copied to the folder round1. 

3. The hbnet.xml script in the round1 folder searches for all possible TYR/GLY/ASP/GLU motifs with hbnet. The sensitivity of the Hbnet protocol was optimized based on the ability to find the networks in relaxed native proteins. All the motifs found for a given backbones were recombined by side-chain copy/pasting (run the script get_all_motifs.py). The resulting models were copied into the round2 folder.

4.Since HBnet gives often strange results, do another round
