# Project Title

De novo design of transmembrane beta-barrels

## Description

This folder contains all the inptuts necessary to re-design the surface of previously reported crystal structures of water-soluble de novo designed beta-barrels with hydrophobic residues, including the characteristic aromatic girdles at the water/lipid interface.
The files are further described in the Material and Methods section of the manuscript.

### Prerequisites

It is necessary to obtain a licence and install the Rosetta Molecular Modelling Suite. The latest version of Rosetta that was used to test this code is provided in the Material and Methods section of the manuscript.
